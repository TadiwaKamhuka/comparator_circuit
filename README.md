# 4 Bit Greater Than Circuit

A 4 bit greater than circuit made up of two, 2 bit greater than and equality circuits. The 2 bit equality circuit is made from two 1 bit equality circuits. Everything is done using dataflow modelling which requires constructing truth tables for the functions. Comparator is the top module.
