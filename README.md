# comparator_circuit
Gate level implementation of a 4 bit greater than circuit using verilog

4 bit greater than circuit made up of two 2 bit greater than and equality circuits. The 2 bit equality circuit is made from two 1 bit equality circuits. Everything is done using dataflow modelling which requires constructing truth tables for the functions.
